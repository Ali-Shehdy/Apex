## Project Description

The **Events Web App** is designed to streamline the management of events,allowing users to
create, update, and manage various events in a user-friendly interface.

This application serves as a platform for event organizers to efficiently handle bookings,
manage guest lists, and track staffing needs.

The application leverages modern web technologies and follows best practices in software 
development to ensure scalability, security, and performance.

This project was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment,focusing on building 
a functional and well-structured web page. The goal was to implement the necessary features
while maintaining clear organization,usability, and clean code.



## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ali-Shehdy/Apex


   ## Must Requirement 
1. Book, edit and cancel Food for an Event
user should be able to choose a food item (or several items) and submit a booking for an event.
this usually includes:

- A form

- Fields for selecting food (dropdown, checkboxes, etc.)

- A submit button

- Code that stores the booking (temporarily or in a simple local list)
Editing a Food Booking

This means the user should be able to change a previously selected food item.
For example:

Change “Chicken Meal” to “Vegetarian Meal”, Update the quantity, Update details before the event

This can be done by:

Displaying the list of current bookings
Adding an Edit button next to each one
Showing a form that lets the user modify the existing booking
Canceling a Food Booking

User must be able to remove a booking entirely.
Each booking can have a Cancel/Delete button
Clicking it removes that booking from the displayed list

How this fits in my assignment

Building a webpage and provide:

A booking form, A section showing booked items
Buttons that let the user edit or cancel those items
